                <h2>MotörHead</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Motörhead were an English rock band formed in London in 1975 by bassist<br>
                    and lead vocalist Lemmy Kilmister, guitarist Larry Wallis and drummer Lucas Fox.<br>
                    Lemmy was also the primary songwriter and only constant member. <br>
                    The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal,<br>
                    hich re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<br>
                    Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Motörhead, <br>
                    most of their best-selling albums and singles feature <br>
                    drummer Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor and guitarist "Fast" Eddie Clarke.<br>
                    From 1995 until the band's break-up in 2015, the group consisted of <br>
                    Lemmy, guitarist Phil Campbell and drummer Mikkey Dee.<br>
                    <br>
                    Motörhead released 23 studio albums, 10 live recordings, <br>
                    12 compilation albums and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. <br>
                    Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s <br>
                    with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. <br>
                    The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades and, particularly, <br>
                    the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith cemented Motörhead's <br>
                     reputation as a top-tier rock band.<br>
                    The band are ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.<br>
                    By 2023, the band has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.<br>
                    <br>
                    Most often classified as heavy metal, Motörhead has been credited with <br>
                    being part of and influencing numerous musical scenes, <br>
                    thrash metal and speed metal especially.<br>
                    Lemmy, however, always insisted that they were a rock and roll band. <br>
                    He said they had more in common with punk bands, <br>
                    but with their own unique sound, <br>
                    Motörhead is embraced in both punk and metal scenes. <br>
                    Their lyrics typically covered such topics as<br>
                     war, good and evil, abuse of power, promiscuity, substance abuse and, most famously, gambling, <br>
                    the last theme being the focus of their hit song "Ace of Spades".<br>
                    
                    Lemmy died on 28 December 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure, <br>
                    after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.<br>
                    The day after his death, longtime members Dee and Campbell<br>
                    both confirmed that Motörhead had disbanded. <br>
                    By 2018, all three members of Motörhead's best-known line-up (Lemmy, Taylor and Clarke) had died.<br>
